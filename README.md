# rmate.c

A lightweight C implementation of [rmate](https://github.com/textmate/rmate),
the remote editing client for TextMate, VS Code (via
[Remote VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rafaelmaiolla.remote-vscode)),
Sublime Text (via
[RemoteSubl](https://github.com/randy3k/RemoteSubl)), and other editors that speak the rmate protocol.

`rmate` lets you open files on a remote server in your local editor over an SSH
tunnel. The C version is a drop-in replacement for the
[Bash](https://github.com/aurora/rmate),
[Python](https://github.com/sclukey/rmate-python), and
[Ruby](https://github.com/textmate/rmate) versions, with significantly faster
startup, lower memory usage, and zero runtime dependencies.

## Quick Start

```sh
# Build
make

# Install (default: /usr/bin)
sudo make install

# Open a file
rmate myfile.txt

# Read from stdin, edit, write result to stdout
echo "hello" | rmate -w -
```

The editor must be listening on the rmate port (default 52698). For SSH usage,
set up a reverse tunnel:

```sh
ssh -R 52698:localhost:52698 user@remote
```

Or add to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host myserver
  RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698
```

## Usage

```
Usage: rmate [options] file [file ...]
       rmate [options] -      (read from stdin and write the edit to stdout)
       rmate [options] - >out (read from stdin and save the edit to file 'out')

Options:
  -H HOST  Connect to host. Use 'auto' to detect from SSH.
           Defaults to $RMATE_HOST or localhost.
  -p PORT  Port number to use for connection.
           Defaults to $RMATE_PORT or 52698.
  -w       Wait for file to be closed by TextMate.
  -l LINE  Place cursor on line number. Repeat for each file,
           e.g. -l 5 -l 10 file1 file2 (5 for file1, 10 for file2).
  -m NAME  The display name shown in TextMate.
  -f       Open even if file is not writable.
  -v       Verbose logging messages.
  -V       Print version information.
  -h       Print this help.
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable     | Description                          | Default     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| `RMATE_HOST` | Editor host to connect to            | `localhost` |
| `RMATE_PORT` | Editor port to connect to            | `52698`     |

Setting `RMATE_HOST=auto` detects the client IP from `SSH_CONNECTION`.

## Enhancements over the Original C Version

This is a rewrite of the original
[rmate.c by Mael Clerambault](https://github.com/hanklords/rmate.c). The following
is a summary of changes compared to the upstream `origin/master`.

**NOTE**: The code changes are made with the help of [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli),
but I spent a lot of time reviewing and revising them very carefully. So don't
panic, it's not just trivial AI generated code :-).

### New Features

- **Stdin support (`-`)**: Read from stdin, send to the editor, and write the
  edited result back to stdout. The original only supported named files.
- **Multiple files**: Open several files in a single invocation
  (`rmate a.txt b.txt`). The original was limited to one file.
- **Per-file line selection (`-l`)**: Jump to a specific line number in each
  file. Supports multiple `-l` flags, one per file.
- **Per-file display names (`-m`)**: Override the tab name shown in the editor
  for each file.
- **Force open (`-f`)**: Open read-only files with a warning instead of
  refusing.
- **Verbose logging (`-v`)**: Detailed protocol-level logging to stderr for
  debugging connection issues.
- **Auto host detection (`-H auto`)**: Automatically extract the client IP
  from the `SSH_CONNECTION` environment variable.

### Robustness Improvements

- **Complete rewrite of I/O handling**: All `read()`/`write()` calls handle
  `EINTR`, partial reads, and partial writes correctly. The original used bare
  `read()`/`write()` without retry.
- **Streaming file send**: Files are streamed from the file descriptor directly
  to the socket in chunks (`stream_data`), instead of being `mmap()`'d into
  memory. This keeps RSS constant regardless of file size.
- **Proper protocol buffer management**: The receive loop uses `memmove()` to
  shift unconsumed bytes to the front of the buffer, correctly handling TCP
  fragmentation where a single `read()` may return partial lines. The original
  assumed each `read()` returned aligned protocol messages.
- **Save-path error resilience**: `receive_save` uses a drain mode — if
  writing to disk fails, it continues reading from the socket to keep the
  protocol stream in sync rather than leaving the connection in an
  indeterminate state. Save failures are counted and reflected in the exit
  code without aborting saves for other files.
- **Clean socket shutdown**: Uses `shutdown(SHUT_WR)` followed by a timed
  drain before `close()`, preventing RST packets on macOS/BSD.
- **Proper background detach**: Uses `fork()` + `setsid()` to fully detach
  from the controlling terminal, preventing `SIGHUP`/`SIGINT` from killing
  the background save handler.
- **SIGPIPE handling**: Ignores `SIGPIPE` so a broken editor connection
  produces a clean error message instead of a silent crash.
- **Filename validation**: Rejects filenames containing `\n` or `\r` to
  prevent protocol injection.
- **File descriptor hygiene**: All file descriptors are opened with
  `O_CLOEXEC` (or equivalent) to prevent leaks across `fork()`.
- **Memory safety**: All allocations are checked, all paths go through
  `goto cleanup` for deterministic resource release, and `size_t` overflow
  is detected in the stdin buffer growth.

## Performance

See [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md) for detailed measurements. Summary:

| Metric | C | Bash | Python | Ruby |
|--------|---|------|--------|------|
| Startup | **0.3 ms** | 2.2 ms | 34 ms | 44 ms |
| Memory (file mode) | **1.7 MB constant** | 3.7 MB constant | Scales with file | Scales with file |
| Memory (100 MB stdin) | **104 MB** | 496 MB | 215 MB | 120 MB |

## Protocol

See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for a description of the rmate wire protocol.
